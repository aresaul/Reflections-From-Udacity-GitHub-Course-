When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-I would want to create a remote repository if I had, say, multiple computers working on the same project.
For example, if I was working on a work project at home and had two different computers contributing to the same git repo.
This would also be useful if collaborating with others in a team environment.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
-Pulling changes manually gives you a greater degree of control over what your local directory looks like.
If GitHub were to automatically push changes to your local environment, you might not be "kept in the loop"
so to speak, about what your local environment looks like.  Collaborators would be able to alter your local
environment without your permission, so this isn't a good idea.
