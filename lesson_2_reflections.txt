What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
-When you initialize a repository, git creates a file inside the repository (a .git file) so that 
the changes to that directory can be tracked.  I need to remember that it doesn't automatically commit
for you, the first commit (just like subsequent commits) needs to be made manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think
it offers?
-The staging area is different because it is only a temporary area to hold information in.  It helps
to differentiate between what is saved (in the working directory) and what is committed (in git).
The advantage of having such an area is that it allows the user to change single or multiple files in 
a commit.
